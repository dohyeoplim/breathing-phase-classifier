\section{Conclusion}

We presented a lightweight reproducible pipeline for noninvasive detection of breathing phases from short audio clips. We extracted spectral and scalar features and used CutMix and MixUp to improve Kaggle test set accuracy from 72.0\% public and 69.3\% private to 78.6\% and 76.7\% respectively. A simple ensemble of CNN8 and a VGG inspired network added two percentage points and showed the value of model combination. The system requires no specialized hardware or manual review and suits real time home use scenarios. Future work will address classification of pathological sounds such as wheeze and evaluate end to end deep models on raw audio data to improve performance.
